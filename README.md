# Robot-Project

This Project Displays a series of shapes(Robots) on a java gui. This code was written for a UOA project
A lot of the code required to make the program run has been kept off Github because it was written by the lecturer
and I don't own it. So the code which is put up just shows what I did. All the robots extend an abstract class Robot which
was partially written by the lecturer.
